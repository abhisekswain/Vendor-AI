# Vendor-AI
Vendor-AI is a webapp designed for vendors and bulk-sellers at e-commerce sites. It enables a vendor or seller at sites like amazon.com or ebay.com to upload a picture of the product they want to sell and automatically curates a product page by filling in the necessary textual information. To develop the app, I chose perfumes as my product category and scraped over 20,000+ perfume images and textual data from basenotes.com. Vendor-AI uses computer vision for image matching and flask for displaying image and textual information.

## Motivation
Before embarking on my journey as a data scientist, I was a product manager and had to create product pages for my products. I found the process to be time-consuming and cumbersome. The same sentiment has been echoed product managers I talked to at amazon and ebay, specially those who deal with vendors and bulk sellers. Vendors and bulk sell a large number of products on these sites and have to spend considerable amount of time creating creating a product page for each product. Therefore, I set out to build a simple intuitive UI that accomplished this goal, by allowing the user to upload a picture of the product and curating a product page thus automating the selling process.

 

## Data Collection
I scraped 20,000+ images and text from basenotes.com. An example perfuke is below. For each perfume, I stored relevant information in a mongoDB including:

1. Name
2. Year
3. Gender
4. Availability
5. House
6. About
7. Fragrance notes
