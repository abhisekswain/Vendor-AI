# Vendor-AI
Vendor-AI is a webapp designed for vendors and bulk-sellers at e-commerce sites. It enables a vendor or seller at sites like amazon.com or ebay.com to upload a picture of the product they want to sell and automatically curates a product page by filling in the necessary textual information. To develop the app, I chose perfumes as my product category and scraped over 20,000+ perfume images and textual data from basenotes.com. Vendor-AI uses computer vision for image matching Flask for displaying image and textual information.
